## State of the Maintenance

As Andrey and I(Alexander) are fully committed to the **NextCloud App Ecosystem** project, 
we will be working tirelessly around the clock for the next two months. 
Due to our intense dedication to that project, our availability will be limited during this period. 
However, we encourage and welcome any contributions from the community in the form of pull requests.

After Nextcloud App Ecosystem V2 finished we'll rewrite MediaDC to use the new system, and write many other amazing applications.

For All Coders who want to write New Amazing Applications for 
Nextcloud with New App Ecosystem - we are available to discuss its API, prototypes, etc. in their repositories.
